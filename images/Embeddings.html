                        from large language models (sometimes referred to as GPT models) like GPT-4. The methods
                        described here can sometimes be deployed in combination for greater effect. We encourage
                        experimentation to find the methods that work best for you. <br>

                        Using OpenAI's Prompt engineering models, you can build applications to: <br>

                        Include details in your query to get more relevant answers <br>
                        Ask the model to adopt a persona <br>
                        Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input <br>
                        Specify the steps required to complete a task <br>
                        Provide examples <br>
                        Specify the desired length of the output <br>
                        Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining prompts used to interact with
                        language models, such as me. In the context of text generation models like GPT (Generative
                        Pre-trained Transformer), prompts serve as input cues that guide the model in generating desired
                        responses.

                        Prompt engineering involves crafting prompts that elicit specific types of responses from the
                        model, such as generating coherent text, providing accurate information, or completing a task.
                        This process often requires understanding the capabilities and limitations of the language model
                        being used and tailoring prompts accordingly.

                        Effective prompt engineering involves several considerations:

                        Clarity: Prompts should clearly communicate the desired task or context to the model, guiding it
                        to produce relevant responses.

                        Specificity: Prompts should be specific enough to encourage the model to generate responses that
                        meet the user's needs or expectations.

                        Length: The length of the prompt can influence the quality and relevance of the model's
                        response. In some cases, concise prompts may be more effective, while in others, longer prompts
                        may provide additional context.

                        Examples: Providing examples of desired responses or formatting can help the model better
                        understand the prompt's expectations.

                        Fine-tuning: In some cases, fine-tuning the model on specific prompts or tasks can improve its
                        performance in generating relevant responses.

                        Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in leveraging language models effectively for various
                        applications, such as chatbots, content generation, question-answering systems, and more. By
                        carefully designing prompts, developers can harness the power of language models to create
                        engaging and useful interactions.
